# Compiling.


There are two ways.



- HTMLIFIER : using HTMLify will allow you to take advantage of all the functions of Amigo 6.
- Forkphorus : using Forkphorus using forkphorus will prevent you from using the Camera app, but will allow you to do automatic packaging for nwjs and thus create a standalone Amigo app.However, you can do manual packaging using the file created with HTMLifier and create a standalone app with Camera app support.
